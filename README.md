# Summer Institute in Statistics for Big Data Workshop: Supervised Machine Learning
## Seattle, WA - July 18-20, 2018
Notes and R code

### Wednesday July 18, 2018 1:30p - 5:00 pm
- y = outcomes, x = design matrix or covariates, n = number of observations, p = number of covariates
- betas = for every 1 unit increase in X, Y changes by beta assuming all other variables remain constant
- low dimensional - few covariates, lots of observations, n>>p
- high dimensional - era of big data - n = p, or n<<p
- can covariates be combined - discrete (and/or ordered) and continuous data
- too many covariates results in overfitting
- when p = n, or p > n, overfitting is almost guanteed
    - overfitting results from degrees of freedom...
- more difficult to design how many samples are needed, no p-values, or concepts of power
